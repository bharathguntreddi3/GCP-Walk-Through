Region_Zones:  
	Resources that live in a zone are referred to as zonal resources. 
Virtual machine Instances and persistent disks live in a zone. 
To attach a persistent disk to a virtual machine instance, 
both resources must be in the same zone. 
Similarly, if you want to assign a static IP address to an instance, 
the instance must be in the same region as the static IP.
